- Makes use of regex operations to split the string and additional characters in it produce a clean texual data.
- Takes in the clean texual data and makes use of  `TextBlob` on it to assign the polarity to that particular tweet.
- Iterates this function over the dataframe(specifically dataframe column 'Tweets') to get the polarity of all the tweets.
